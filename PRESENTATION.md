## outline

Explain the basics of audio steganography
- What is audio steg? (hiding things)
- How does LSB work? (draw/type out how bits are placed in the file to put message together)
- Mention other methods (shoutout echo hiding! henry/perry!)

Demonstrate the process using our code
- Play encoded version (1 bit) of Softcore, play non-encoded version and show how unnoticeable it is
- Show how to compile encode/decode, bit stuff as well (show that the entire book went through the process unscathed! (except apostrophes oooops))
- Show audio quality difference between 1/2/4 bit versions
- Use Audacity to show differences in spectrogram between 1/2/4/non-enc versions
